## Application Description
**Video Game Vault** is a web application developed with **Django** that centralizes information about video games obtained through *web scraping*. The platform allows you to explore video games, perform advanced searches, and discover personalized recommendations, combining simplicity and power in one place.

**Purpose:** Video Game Vault was created as a tool to centralize video game information and facilitate their search and discovery, ideal for gamers and collectors.

### Key Features:
- **Data Retrieval:**
  - Video games are automatically collected from [**Instant Gaming**](https://www.instant-gaming.com/) and [**Eneba**](https://www.eneba.com/) using **Beautiful Soup**.
  - Data is stored in a database and organized for various searches.

- **Searches:**
  - **Simple Searches:** Directly with Django, explore video games using basic filters such as genre, developer, platform...
  - **Advanced Searches:** Use **Whoosh** for more complex queries, such as specific keyword matches.

- **Authentication for Advanced Features:**
  - Some features, such as data loading, the recommendation system, or advanced searches, are only available to authenticated users.

- **Detailed Video Game View:**
  - View details such as release date, description, price, discount, rating, developer, genres, and platforms.
  - Discover personalized recommendations based on similarities with other video games.

- **Content-Based Recommendation System:**
  - Based on content, it uses vectors that combine attributes of video games.
  - Implemented with tools like **spaCy** for natural language text processing, **scikit-learn** for similarity calculations, and **NumPy** for vector construction.

### Technologies Used:
- **Django:** The main framework for application development.
- **Beautiful Soup:** For data extraction via *web scraping*.
- **Whoosh:** Search engine for advanced queries.
- **spaCy, scikit-learn, and NumPy:** Key components for the content-based recommendation system.


## Steps to Start the Project
### Clone the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jaime-Linares/VideoGame_Vault.git
```

### Install Dependencies
You have two options to work: with or without a virtual environment.

#### 1. Install Dependencies with virtual environment
##### Using Linux
* **Create the virtual environment:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv

venv\Scripts\activate
``` 
* **If you get an error related to script execution, you can temporarily modify the policy with:**
```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
``` 
* **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
